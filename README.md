# organizer
A simple python script to organize files into directories.  I made this script to organize miscellaneous folders like my downloads folder, or the contents of a flash drive.  Please use, distribute, or modify any way you like; this is a simple tool for personal use only.

# Instructions
NOTE: As of now this script will only run on OSX/Linux since it is only compatibile with UNIX formatted filepaths

Move organizer.py into the directory you would like to organize and run the script. That's all! Feel free to edit the EXT_LIST dictionary in the source code if you would like to include other file extentions or other folder categories.
